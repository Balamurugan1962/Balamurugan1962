# Hi, I'm Balamurugan S

I'm an enthusiastic developer who loves building new things and exploring different areas of tech. I enjoy solving problems, participating in hackathons, and constantly learning through hands-on projects.

Youâ€™ll find me working on everything from web apps to AI experiments, all shared openly on GitHub and Codolio. Always curious, always building.
